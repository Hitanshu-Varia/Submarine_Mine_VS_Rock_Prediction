# Submarine_Mine_VS_Rock_Prediction

🚢 Mine vs Rock Classification using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either a mine or a rock. It uses a logistic regression classifier trained on the Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📌 Project Overview
Problem Type: Binary Classification

Objective: Predict whether the object is a mine (M) or a rock (R) based on sonar signal frequencies.

Model Used: Logistic Regression

Library: Scikit-learn

🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy

Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualizations)

🧪 Features
Data preprocessing and stratified train-test split

Logistic Regression model training
